## A simple machine learning model applied to audio

In this app, we will be able to run through the steps to build a simple machine learning model applied to audio.

## CHALLENGE
Imagine you work for a famous and solid radio station. There are old programs that are being digitized from cassettes and your first mission is to organize the audio files. In this organization, you want to classify what is music and what is speech or broadcast. You have already a classified dataset and you want to use the help of artificial intelligence to optimize your work.

What would be your first step?
